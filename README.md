In recent years, traffic flow prediction has become vital for managing intelligent transportation systems; however, traditional methods often suffer from static spatial modeling, hindering their ability to accurately capture dynamic and complex time-space relationships, thus affecting prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose SFADNet, an innovative traffic flow prediction network that categorizes traffic into multiple patterns using temporal and spatial feature matrices. For each identified pattern, SFADNet constructs an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph guided by a cross-attention mechanism, incorporating residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to effectively capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships across various fine-grained traffic patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFADNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four large-scale datasets.
